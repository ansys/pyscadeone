Operators
=========

This section describes operators and signatures related classes.

Signature and operator declarations are detailed in :doc:`operator`.

The body of an operator consists of *sections*, detailed as follows:

* Variable declaration in section :doc:`var`
* Equation declaration in section :doc:`equation`
* Activations and state machines, which are parts of equation concepts are 
  described in separate sections: :doc:`activation` and :doc:`automaton` 
* Formal property sections for **assume** and **guarantee** are grouped in the
  section :doc:`other_sections`, with the **emission** scope section
* Diagrams are detailed in section :doc:`diagram`
