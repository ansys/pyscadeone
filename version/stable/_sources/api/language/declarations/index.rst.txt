Declarations
============

This section describes the classes that represent Swan declarations.

Declarations are the global definitions: *const*, *sensor*, *type* and *group*.
Declarations are also *operator* in a module body and operator signature in the interface of 
a module interface.

The API defines classes that are used by other classes, like class for path identifiers.
These classes are grouped in the *Common Classes* section.
